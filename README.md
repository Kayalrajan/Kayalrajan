- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kayalrajan
- ðŸ‘€ With over 10 years of experience in Data Engineering and ETL Development, coupled with significant expertise in AWS cloud technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team.

During my career, I have successfully designed, implemented, and optimized data pipelines for large-scale data platforms. My experience includes migrating data infrastructures from on-premises environments to AWS, utilizing services such as Amazon S3, Glue,  RDS, Redshift, and Lambda to ensure efficient data storage, processing, and retrieval. I have a strong background in developing scalable ETL processes using tools like Informatica, DataStage, and PySpark, and I have routinely integrated these pipelines with cloud-based solutions to drive business success.
